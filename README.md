Repo for Algorithms &amp; Data Structures course

These Labs and Projects were completed by me during my Fall 2019 semester at James Madison University

They display my proficiency working with fundamental algorithms (lambdas, advanced recursion, sorting, searching, hashing, algorithm analysis) and data structures (linear structures, graphs/trees, hash tables, etc.)

Disclaimer: Not all of this code is my own. Students were given stubs by the professor to complete on our own.
